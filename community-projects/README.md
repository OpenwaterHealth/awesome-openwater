### Acoustic Field Optimizer

**By:** Jane Researcher / Stanford University  
**Date:** December 2025  
**Platform:** OpenLIFU  
**Category:** Technical Extension

**Description:**  
An optimization tool that automatically adjusts ultrasound parameters to maximize acoustic pressure at target locations while minimizing skull heating. Uses gradient descent algorithms for real-time parameter tuning.

**Key Innovation:**  
First open-source tool for automated ultrasound parameter optimization with skull heating constraints.

**Links:**
- GitHub: https://github.com/username/acoustic-optimizer
- Paper: https://doi.org/10.xxxx/example
- Demo: https://youtube.com/watch?v=example

**Images:**  
![Optimization Interface](https://example.com/screenshot.png)

**Technologies Used:**
